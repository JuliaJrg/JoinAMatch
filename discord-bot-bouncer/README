# Bot Join A Match Roles

## Installations :

To install and configure the bot, make sure to use the following command: "node index.js" to bring the bot online.

If you make updates to the "rule" feature, navigate to the file located in: "commands/fluxrss.js".

Once you have updated the code, run the "node deploy-commands.js" command, which is a command loader that will update the bot with the code you previously wrote in the file.

Final step: Restart the bot with the following command: "node index.js"

Then test the bot.
